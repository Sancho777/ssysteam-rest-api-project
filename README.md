# Profiles REST API

Source Code for SSYS Employee Manager

This is a simple API to create update and delete Employee profiles

I used Django and Django Rest Framework and it was deployed in the following links:

Admin Panel:
http://adrianosanchesss777.pythonanywhere.com/admin/

You can use this superuser to access the admin panel:

email: admin@admin123.com
senha: admin123

Profile List:
http://adrianosanchesss777.pythonanywhere.com/api/profile/

In the profile page you can create new Employees profiles and after reloading the page you will see the new Employee on the list.
You can take the id number of the employee and add to the link path to access the upload and delete page.

Ex: http://adrianosanchesss777.pythonanywhere.com/api/profile/2


You can also clone the project in your own machine.
